### _Who?_
I'm Dan Moore [he/him], I'm an Artist, Designer, and Technologist based here in New York City.  I design and build interactive activations and applications.  

I leverage media frameworks, game engines, textiles, and robotic arms to create immersive environments that examine human behavior, pop-culture, and culture dichotomies. My work is inspired by the idea of HYPE and the manipulation of media to achieve it. I strive to create a fully immersive environment for the audience to not only experience but become an active participant in the work.

Recently, I've been creating sneakers with machine learning and calling them [*airegan](www.aire-gan.com)

I've worked at an experimentals UX design studio inside Samsung Mobile. I led a team at Squarespace doing conceptual product design.  I did a couple tour's of duty at the Google Creative Lab where I led the development of [_Just A Line_](https://justaline.withgoogle.com), prototyped an early version of [_Verne_](https://verne.withgoogle.com), developed the [_Morse Code gBoard_](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/9011881?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid), and prototyped the [_Notable Women_](https://notablewomen.withgoogle.com) AR experience.  I've worked with advertising agencies, experiential agencies, and architecture firms to build interactive installations such as creating a video game played with a car, an F1 driver, and a Passenger with an iPad for a campaign called [_Trace Your Road_](https://vimeo.com/74125559).  I'm currently fulltime with NVIDIA working with their creative team on tools and workflows for virtual production, including realtime motion capture and robotic arm integrations.
