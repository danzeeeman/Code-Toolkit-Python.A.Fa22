_So what did everyone thing of the reading?_

Marshall McLuhan made some interesting statements huh?

_The title "The Medium Is the Massage" is a teaser—a way of getting attention. There's a wonderful sign hanging in a Toronto junkyard which reads, 'Help Beautify Junkyards. Throw Something Lovely Away Today.' This is a very effective way of getting people to notice a lot of things. And so the title is intended to draw attention to the fact that a medium is not something neutral—it does something to people. It takes hold of them. It rubs them off, it massages them and bumps them around, chiropractically, as it were, and the general roughing up that any new society gets from a medium, especially_


More importantly I want you to take away this:

The communication channel used to communicate any message shapes the message itself.  So if you see a instagram ad that ad was manufactured to get _you_ to click it.  That promoted tweet was crafted to get you to pay attention to it.  That TikTok, was engineered to be captivating. Remember that the way a message is communicated influences the design of the message itself.


Continuing Eduction in Media Studies read [Manufacturing Consent by Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky](/pdfs/Manufacturing%20Consent%20%5BThe%20Political%20Economy%20Of%20The%20Mass%20Media%5D.pdf) and write a short essay on the _Propaganda Model_ (this will replace 2 missed coding homeworks)
